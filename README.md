## 🌟 Project Description

**Pookalam Pie** is a festive browser game inspired by the vibrant traditions of Onam.
Players select from **10 colorful flowers**, decorate a glowing **1/8th slice** of the pookalam, and watch in delight as the slice blossoms into a **complete floral design**.

With background music, confetti, and color-shifting animations — it’s a playful digital celebration of Onam, blending tradition with technology. 🌼🌈✨

## 🎯 The Problem

Making a real pookalam requires space, time, and a lot of flowers 🌸🌺🌼.
But what if you could create a **beautiful digital pookalam instantly**, from anywhere in the world?

---

## 🌸 The Solution

I created **Pookalam Pie** — a fun, interactive way to design pookalams online.
It keeps the joy of choosing flowers and patterns, while adding magical extras like glowing slices, animated confetti, and a festive background score 🎶.

It’s **Onam celebrations on your screen** 🥳.

Do you want me to make this README more **formal (like a hackathon project)** or more **festive with emojis and decorative headings** (so it feels like part of an Onam celebration)?
